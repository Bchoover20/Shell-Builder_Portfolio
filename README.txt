Designed and implemented my own shell that would take user input, parse the string into tokens through strtok() function, recognize if the user input is an internal command contained within Bourne-Again shell (bash), execute the command with its associated arguments (execv), and redisplay initial prompt (“>”) when execution complete.
•
Shell also supported loading and executing plugins that were found within the system.
